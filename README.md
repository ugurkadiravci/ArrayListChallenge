The challenge is to create an interactive console program, with a menu of options as shown here, and functionality that I will describe now:

    Available actions:
                
    0 - to shutdown
                
    1 - to add item(s) to list (comma delimited list)
                
    2 - to remove any items (comma delimited list)
                
    Enter a number for which action you want to do:
                

Using the Scanner class, solicit a menu choice, 0, 1, or 2, and process the item accordingly.

The list will be a grocery list and should be an ArrayList.

You should use methods on the ArrayList to add items, remove items, check if an item is already in the list, and print a sorted list.

You should print the list, sorted alphabetically, after each operation.

You shouldn't allow duplicate items in the list.
